# WordPress Media Corps Project Tracker
The WordPress Media Corps is a new experimental project that aims to enable independent WordPress marketers and media members to produce excellent quality content with less time and effort. We use [this GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/208) to track work and tasks for this project.


**What does this look like in practice?**

The WordPress Media Corps project is intentionally adopting a limited scope that we can confidently manage to test the viability and assumptions to achieve the desired goal. In practice, this means the project will focus on compiling updates and news across the project that would benefit from increased awareness and getting them to WordPress media partners and marketers more readily through regular briefings/meetings.

For more information and context about the Media Corps project, you can refer to the [Media Corps Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/media-corps/handbook/) and these posts:
